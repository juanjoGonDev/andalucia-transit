### Component Refactor Plan (2025-10-16)

⚠️ **Design Integrity Requirement:**  
All layout, spacing, typography, color, shape, shadow, and positioning values must remain pixel-identical to the current baseline UI.  
The existing home layout serves as the **visual baseline**. Any deviation in spacing, font weight, hue, border radius, alignment, or visual hierarchy constitutes a regression.  
This phase is purely structural and organizational — no aesthetic changes are allowed.

- [x] Extract a global `AppLayoutComponent` from the existing layout structure, preserving every exact visual metric: container width, corner radius, background gradients, shadows, typography scale, and spacing values.
      The resulting component must render identically to the current baseline layout before any routing changes.
- [x] Reconfigure `app.routes.ts` so `AppLayoutComponent` hosts all feature child routes via a nested router outlet, ensuring **zero visual drift** (same DOM hierarchy, computed sizes, and offsets).
      Verify using snapshot comparison or automated DOM diffing.
- [x] Provide a shared layout context (directive + injection token) allowing feature modules to project content or update tab states **without modifying layout dimensions** or introducing new structural wrappers.
- [x] Replace all Angular Material dialog usage with a custom overlay dialog service while preserving the exact overlay geometry, padding, elevation, focus behavior, and backdrop styling.
  - [x] Introduce `OverlayDialogService` abstraction and reroute existing confirm dialog callers through it without altering rendering.
  - [x] Provide overlay dialog ref injection so dialog components no longer depend on `MatDialogRef` directly while retaining identical behavior.
  - [x] Rewire Home nearby stops dialog to consume the overlay dialog ref provider with unchanged interactions.
  - [x] Remove Angular Material dialog structural directives from the shared dialog layout while keeping semantics and visuals unchanged.
  - [x] Replace the Material dialog host with a custom CDK overlay container that mirrors focus handling, backdrop styling, and geometry while keeping visuals identical.
- [x] Build shared form primitives (text field, autocomplete, date picker) inside `shared/ui/forms/` replicating the current field metrics and interaction behavior — identical typography, borders, radius, hover/focus states, and spacing.
  - [x] Scaffold `AppTextFieldComponent` with prefix, suffix, and hint slots plus ControlValueAccessor support ready for migration.
        No change to visual hierarchy or proportions is allowed.
  - [x] Expose text field interaction outputs so upcoming autocomplete primitives can orchestrate focus and value changes without altering layout.
  - [x] Merge hint and external described-by metadata on `AppTextFieldComponent` so accessibility cues remain intact during migration.
  - [x] Scaffold `AppAutocompleteComponent` with keyboard navigation, selection outputs, and projected panel structure while maintaining baseline text field metrics.
  - [x] Scaffold `AppDatePickerComponent` with parsing and formatting hooks backed by the shared text field while preserving baseline metrics.
- [x] Introduce domain facades to abstract data services from presentation components, ensuring no change in rendering, timing, or layout stability.
  - [x] Provide a recent searches facade combining history, preview, execution, and preferences coordination for the home dashboard.
  - [x] Provide a favorites facade that encapsulates favorites persistence and exposes presentation-ready streams without altering UI behavior.
  - [x] Provide a stop schedule facade so stop detail presentation loads schedules through the domain layer without modifying UI rendering.
  - [x] Adopt the favorites facade across all presentation components currently depending on stop favorites services.
    - [x] Home dashboard favorites preview relies on the favorites facade stream instead of the stop favorites service.
    - [x] Route search form favorites shortcuts use the favorites facade rather than injecting the stop favorites service.
    - [x] Favorites view consumes the favorites facade exclusively, avoiding direct references to the stop favorites service.
  - [x] Route search components resolve stop directory data through a dedicated facade instead of injecting the stop directory service.
  - [x] Route search form resolves stop connections through a dedicated facade instead of injecting the stop connections data service.
  - [x] Route search selection resolver loads stop directory options and connections through the domain facades while preserving its output contract.
- [x] Consolidate duplicated card components (`HomeListCardComponent`, `CardListItemComponent`, etc.) into a single reusable `InteractiveCardComponent` that maintains identical computed dimensions, typography, shadow, and spacing.
      Validate visual parity against the baseline grid. - [x] Scaffold `InteractiveCardComponent` and migrate `HomeListCardComponent` to consume it without altering rendered markup. - [x] Migrate `CardListItemComponent` to delegate to `InteractiveCardComponent` while retaining identical accessible behavior and styling hooks. - [x] Collapse `StopNavigationItemComponent` into `InteractiveCardComponent`, retaining the existing card list markup and styling classes. - [x] Remove the legacy `HomeListCardComponent` wrapper so features rely on `InteractiveCardComponent` directly while preserving the rendered markup and styles. - [x] Restore Home recent search cards to the baseline visuals while relying on `InteractiveCardComponent` (selectors: `.recent-card`, `.recent-card__body`, `.recent-card__remove`).
- [x] Review orphaned or redundant components (e.g., dialog variants, navigation items) and remove or reassign them only after confirming **no visual or spacing shifts** occur across any layout.
  - [x] Verified remaining shared and feature components still have active entry points after removing dialog and navigation wrappers.
  - [x] Remove unused StopNavigationItemComponent after confirming InteractiveCardComponent now serves every former usage without altering layout metrics.
  - [x] Remove unused HomeNearbyStopsDialogComponent after verifying no entry points remain and route search nearby recommendations cover the former flow.
- [x] Align all feature views (favorites, route search, stop detail, settings, map, etc.) with the unified layout structure using the shared spacing and typography tokens while maintaining pixel parity with the current layout.
      Automated screenshot comparison must confirm zero differences.
  - [x] Favorites view registers its layout content region with the shared host while preserving pixel-identical rendering.
  - [x] Home dashboard registers its layout content region with the shared host while preserving pixel-identical rendering.
  - [x] Route search view registers its layout content region with the shared host while preserving pixel-identical rendering.
  - [x] Stop detail view registers its layout content region with the shared host while preserving pixel-identical rendering.
  - [x] Settings view registers its layout content region with the shared host while preserving pixel-identical rendering.
  - [x] Map view registers its layout content region with the shared host while preserving pixel-identical rendering.
- [x] Expand unit and integration tests to cover:
  - [x] Layout pixel parity (visual regression checks via Storybook or Cypress snapshots).
    - [x] Home layout snapshots (es/en) validated through Cypress visual regression spec.
    - [x] Favorites layout snapshots (es/en) validated through Cypress visual regression spec.
    - [x] Route search layout snapshots (es/en) validated through Cypress visual regression spec.
    - [x] Stop detail layout snapshots (es/en) validated through Cypress visual regression spec.
    - [x] Map layout snapshots (es/en) validated through Cypress visual regression spec.
    - [x] Settings layout snapshots (es/en) validated through Cypress visual regression spec.
    - [x] Provide an npm script to run the Cypress visual regression suite headlessly with zero-diff enforcement.
    - [x] Keep Cypress visual baseline artifacts out of version control to preserve local-only snapshots.
    - [x] Centralize visual regression path configuration to eliminate duplicated directory literals.
    - [x] Generate bilingual snapshot scenarios through a shared helper to remove duplication while maintaining zero-diff enforcement in the Cypress spec.
      - [x] Share Cypress visual regression task payload and result types between the config and spec to prevent duplication while maintaining the zero-diff assertion.
  - [x] Dialog overlay focus and accessibility behavior.
  - [x] Form primitive keyboard navigation and ARIA labeling.
        Execute `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` after each phase.  
        The iteration is valid only if **visual comparison reports zero diffs**.

🖼 **Baseline Reference:**  
The current layout, as rendered in the production build, is the **canonical baseline**.  
Each iteration of this refactor must include one or more browser screenshots with accessible URLs demonstrating identical visual output to the baseline.
