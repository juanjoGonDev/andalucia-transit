# Andalucia Transit

Andalucia Transit is a Progressive Web App built with Angular and Angular Material to explore bus stops, routes, and schedules across the Andalusian transport network. It features a clean architecture layout, runtime language switching between Spanish and English, routing for core screens, and PWA capabilities for installability and offline caching.

The workspace ships with ESLint, Prettier, Jasmine/Karma unit testing, and Cypress end-to-end scaffolding. Run `npm start` for local development, `npm run build:prod` for a production bundle, `npm test` for unit tests, and `npm run e2e` for the Cypress smoke test.
